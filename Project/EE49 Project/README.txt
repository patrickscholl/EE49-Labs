# Summary

Very simple gearbox with 2:1 ratio.  The use I intend for it is to gear a micro servo up so that it's 180 degree rotation becomes a full 360 degree rotation.  One axle is designed to attach directly to the servo's output spline with a friction fit and a servo horn screw.

This is still a work in progress.  I've printed it, but it has yet to be attached to a servo. The box seems to work well, the gears mesh correctly, etc.  Seems to have low enough friction for my needs.
